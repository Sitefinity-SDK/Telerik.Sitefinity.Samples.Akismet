Telerik.Sitefinity.Samples.Akismet
==================================

The project shows how you can use the Akismet service to filter spam in Forum posts and comments. It uses the Sitefinity event architecture and listens for when an item is created or updated. It then makes a call to Akismet to verify if the item is spam or not.
